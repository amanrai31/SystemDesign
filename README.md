# SystemDesign

Resource => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9Qh9fWeOAk&t=56s

AIM => Design Reliable, Scalable, Maintainable systems, Highly available(minimizing downtime).

- Data intensive applications => the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at which it is changing
- compute intensive => where CPU cycles are the bottleneck

Building blocks of system design => `Client` | `LoadBalancer` | `Database` | `Cache` | `APIs => Rest/gRPC etc` | `BlobStorage` | `CDN` | `RateLimiting`
